# The `videojs-panorama` plugin

The plugin we’re going to be using is called [videojs-panorama](https://github.com/yanwsh/videojs-panorama).

Incidentally – this is not a plugin made specifically for Cloudinary’s player. But Cloudinary built its player on top of the widely used [VideoJS](http://videojs.com) framework, and plugins for VideoJS work on the Cloudinary Player, as well.
