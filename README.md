For the second half of the event, Dan Zeitman a developer advocate from Cloudinary will also be discussing how web video has changed in recent years.

Web Video is evolving. Last year, on both platforms, 360-degree video accounted for 4.5 billion views on Facebook and YouTube through the first ten months of 2017.

360 VR videos created by platforms like Unity and with a new breed of 360 VR Cameras like the Ricoh Theta and Insta360 One can generate 4K video content that requires additional effort to deliver and display on websites.

We’ll look at the challenges developers face when implementing 360 VR video.
