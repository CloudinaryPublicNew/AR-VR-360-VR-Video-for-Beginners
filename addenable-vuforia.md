# Add/Enable Vuforia

Vuforia comes packaged with recent versions of Unity \(since 2017.2\), but does require a few checkboxes to get it working. Make sure when installing or updating Unity to check the box for Vuforia Augmented Reality support.

A good sanity check to make sure you have Vuforia included in your Unity setup is by selecting “GameObject” in the menu. You should see Vuforia as an option. You still need to enable it.

Start by going to File &gt; Build Settings &gt; Player Settings. On the right-side of your Unity Editor \(Inspector panel\) you will see a number of different setting menus. Click “XR Settings” to expand. Check the box for “Vuforia Augmented Reality Supported”.

You may see warnings appear in your console depending on what you included in your Unity build. Not all platforms will be compatible with Vuforia.

You are now ready to build your AR app!
