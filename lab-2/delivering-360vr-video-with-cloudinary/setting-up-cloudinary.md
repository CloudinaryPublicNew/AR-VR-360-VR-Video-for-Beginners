# Setting up Cloudinary

The first thing you’re going to have to do is set up a Cloudinary account.

So, go ahead and pop on over to the [signup page](https://cloudinary.com/signup).

Once you’ve filled out the form \(don’t forget to customize your cloud name, if you’re so inclined!\) and clicked through a little customer survey, you’re all set. Feel free to click around and check out your new account – there’s a lot of interesting stuff here to see. Today, however, we’re going to be using almost none of it. All we’re going to be doing within this library today is uploading our 360° video.
