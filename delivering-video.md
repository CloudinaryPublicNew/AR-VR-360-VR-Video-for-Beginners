# Delivering Video

Go ahead and click on the video thumbnail to get to itâ€™s detail page.

Your video has a public URL, which you can see on the right side over here:

The url shown is the link to the original video.

Cloudinary Video URLs work just like our image URLs, enabling simple transformations of the video simply by changing the URL.

####Example: Scale Video to 200px wide:
```
http://res.cloudinary.com/de-demo/video/upload/c_scale,w_200/v1518314168/tropical360_qjbr2d.mp4

```

####Example: Video with rounded corners:
```
http://res.cloudinary.com/de-demo/video/upload/r_50/v1518314168/tropical360_qjbr2d.mp4

```
