# Add Apple ID to Xcode

You need an [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin)if you don’t already have one. If you are a member of the Apple Developer Program I think you follow a slightly different method so good luck.

Open Xcode. In the top menu bar go to Xcode &gt; Preferences. When the window opens, go to the Account tab. Click the “+” button and “Add Apple ID” to add your account. Enter your Apple ID and password, your name will be added to the list followed by \(Personal Team\). Unless you are a part of the Apple Developer Program, in which case you should have skipped this section.
