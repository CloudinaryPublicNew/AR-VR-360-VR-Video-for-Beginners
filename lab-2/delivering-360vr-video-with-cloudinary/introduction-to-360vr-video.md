## Introduction

### By Eric Portis and Dan Zeitman

360° VR Video is becoming a popular format for creating immersive video experiences. 360° VR camera lenses capture video with wide-angle lenses and then software converts the fisheye video to equalrectangular video that looks like this:

While this is interesting, it's not a fully-interactive 360° video until you play it back in a video player with 360° playback capabilities.
