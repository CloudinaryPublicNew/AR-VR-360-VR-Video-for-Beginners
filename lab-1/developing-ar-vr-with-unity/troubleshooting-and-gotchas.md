# Troubleshooting & Gotchas

## Troubleshooting & Gotchas

High Sierra had some issues playing nice with my external monitor setup. I had to download a special version of MonoDevelop for Unity to load my project.

Unity does some serious work, so your computer’s battery life is going to suffer, even if you aren’t running the project/game. I recommend sitting close to an outlet.

Watson hears itself when testing on a laptop, so use headphones. My iPhone experience didn’t require headphones, which was super cool.

I turned off multithreading to get my app to crash with a runtime error. Prior to that it was just barfing up some registry information that wasn’t helpful in troubleshooting. I didn’t turn it back on.

Watson Speech-to-Text doesn’t work well in loud rooms so I’d recommend headphones with a mic in this case.
