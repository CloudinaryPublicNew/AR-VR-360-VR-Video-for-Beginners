# Add CyberSoldier Asset

You can access the Unity Asset Store within the Unity Editor. In the center of the Unity Editor, click the “Asset Store” tab. This will open the Asset Store in the center area where your scene was. Click the “Scene” tab to navigate back to it.

Using the search bar, search for “Cyber Soldier”, a free 3D model asset. Click the name and then click the Import button. This may take a few minutes to download the asset.

This model is not animated, but does look pretty cool. One of my initial goals was to not fall down a design hole and start modeling all sorts of things. Based on reviews, it also looks like this model is easy to animate based on the rigging. Maybe something to add to your future to do list!

Let’s put our Cyber Soldier into our Scene so visually we feel like we’ve accomplished something shiny. There are a couple ways to do this, like just about everything with Unity, but I’ll walk through just one.

From the Project Assets folder, click into MyAssets &gt; CyberSoldier. Drag the only item that looks like a model of a Cyber Soldier. You’ll see a GameObject is created in the Hierarchy and a Cyber Soldier appears on the scene.

This is a great time to point out the Transform section in the GameObject Inspector. Make sure the position and rotation are zero’d out. This sets your Cyber Soldier in the middle of the screen.
